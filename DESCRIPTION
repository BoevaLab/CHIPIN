Title: ChIP-seq Intersamples Normalization
Version: 0.1.0
Author: L. Polit
Maintainer: L. Polit <lelia-polit@orange.fr>
Description: The goal of ChIPIN is to provide a normalization procedure to compare signals between different conditions/samples from different ChIP-seq experiments using the same antibody. It will output the resulting density profiles. The normalization is based on the assumption that no differences in ChIP-seq signal should be observed in the regulatory regions of genes whom expression does not change across samples/conditions. Moreover, ChIPIN provides a possibility to qualify the efficiency of the antibody used in the ChIP-seq experiment.
